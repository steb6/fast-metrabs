# Conda environment for human_pose_estimator
# NOTE: This environment installs pip packages targeting CUDA 12 (package names with "cu12").
# If your system CUDA is a different major version (e.g. 11), change the package names
# from "tensorrt-cu12" / "tensorrt-lean-cu12" / "tensorrt-dispatch-cu12" to the matching
# variant (for example: "tensorrt-cu11").
